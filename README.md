# DevOpsWithJavaAzureCloud

## Prerequisites

- **Java Application**: You should have a Java application (Spring Boot, Java EE, etc.) ready for deployment.
- **Azure Account**: Ensure you have an active Azure account.
- **Azure DevOps Organization**: Create an Azure DevOps account if you haven't already.
- **Docker**: Docker should be installed locally for building images.
- **Kubernetes Cluster on AKS**: You should have an AKS cluster running.
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**: Set up ACR to store Docker images.
- **Database**: A database (e.g., Azure SQL, MySQL, etc.) that your Java app connects to.

## 1.Prepare Your Java Application
Ensure your Java application is ready for deployment. If you're using a build tool like Maven or Gradle, make sure your project can be built successfully using:

 mvn clean install (for Maven)<br>
 ./gradlew build (for Gradle)<br>
 If using Spring Boot, ensure your application can run locally with an embedded server like Tomcat or Jetty.

## 2. Dockerize Your Java Application
'''Create a Dockerfile in the root of your project to define how your application will be built and run in Docker.

Example Dockerfile for a Spring Boot Java application:
# Use a base image with OpenJDK
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

# Add the JAR file created by Maven/Gradle build
ARG JAR_FILE=target/*.jar
COPY ${JAR_FILE} app.jar

# Expose the port the app will run on
EXPOSE 8080

# Define the command to run the application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"] '''
