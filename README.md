# DevOpsWithJavaAzureCloud

## Prerequisites

- **Java Application**: You should have a Java application (Spring Boot, Java EE, etc.) ready for deployment.
- **Azure Account**: Ensure you have an active Azure account.
- **Azure DevOps Organization**: Create an Azure DevOps account if you haven't already.
- **Docker**: Docker should be installed locally for building images.
- **Kubernetes Cluster on AKS**: You should have an AKS cluster running.
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**: Set up ACR to store Docker images.
- **Database**: A database (e.g., Azure SQL, MySQL, etc.) that your Java app connects to.

## Prepare Your Java Application
Ensure your Java application is ready for deployment. If you're using a build tool like Maven or Gradle, make sure your project can be built successfully using:

mvn clean install (for Maven)/
./gradlew build (for Gradle)/
If using Spring Boot, ensure your application can run locally with an embedded server like Tomcat or Jetty.
